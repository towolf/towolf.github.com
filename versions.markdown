Historically, users could choose among two different branches of Psychtoolbox-3: `beta` and `stable`.

Since then the `stable` branch has fallen into disuse and has become
deprecated. Day-to-day development now occurs on GitHub, with the `beta` branch
in Subversion serving as the main distribution channel to our users.

| **`beta`**    | current, rolling releases of Psychtoolbox             |
| **`stable`**  | deprecated and unsupported branch, removed in 3.0.10  |

The **`beta`** branch provides the latest features, performance enhancements
and bug fixes. These features have been tested by the [developers][] on the
system configurations at their disposal and should be reasonably safe for real
world use and testing.

However, there may be undiscovered bugs, and with the very limited resources
new stuff needs to see real world use to shake out remaining bugs. We rely on
*you* for the testing of new features and for feedback about problems or bugs.

Versioned Releases
------------------

The `beta` branch of PTB is normally updated for the purpose of introducing
single bug fixes, new features or incremental improvements. Thus the `beta`
branch pushes out rolling releases, and the incremental updates are
reflected in their SVN revision number. 

Executing the command `PsychtoolboxVersion` should return the *version number,
flavor and revision number* of your current Psychtoolbox. The command also
prints a web URL, which points to the online change log where you can read in
detail what has changed between different revisions.

Before any potentially disruptive changes are merged into the `beta` branch, we
tag and release a new version of Psychtoolbox following the versioning scheme
**`Psychtoolbox-3.x.y`**.  Examples of such disruptive changes would be the
discontinuation of support for an operating system, Matlab version, or a computer
hardware platform. We recommend to stick with the `beta` branch, unless you
have good reason not to do so.

Previous Releases
-----------------

The following releases of old Psychtoolbox versions are available.

<small>There were some unfortunately numbered versions 1.0.x released earlier in the
development of PTB-3, but this numbering caused so much confusion with respect
to PTB Version 2 that we have now abandoned that system.</small>

`Psychtoolbox-3.0.9`
   : A snapshot of the code as of May 2012: This was the final 3.0.9 release
     before start of the 3.0.10 series. It was the last version that supports
     Matlab versions older than V7.4 (a.k.a R2007a). It was also the last version
     to support Apple PowerPC hardware. Support for Apple’s Quicktime will be
     also phased out after this version, in favor of the much more modern, free
     and open-source cross-platform GStreamer multimedia framework, which will
     take over Quicktime’s duties.

`Psychtoolbox-3.0.8`
   : A snapshot of the code as of April 2011: This was the final 3.0.8 release
     before start of the 3.0.9 series with its new “mostly MIT” license model.

`Psychtoolbox-3.0.8-PreMatlab6.5`
   : A snapshot of the code as of late 2010: This was the last release that worked
     with Matlab versions before V6.5.

`Psychtoolbox-3.0.8-PreTiger`
   : A snapshot of the code as of February 2009: This was the last release
     that is (assumed, not tested!) to work properly in most parts on Mac OS X
     versions prior to 10.4 “Tiger”, i.e., 10.3 “Panther” and earlier. It was also
     the last release with support for GNU Octave versions prior to 3.2.0 on Mac
     OS and Linux.

`Psychtoolbox-3.0.7`
   : A snapshot of the code as of October 2006: Added basic and limited support
     for movie playback on OSX via Quicktime, some performance enhancements to the
     drawing functions and a few bug fixes.
