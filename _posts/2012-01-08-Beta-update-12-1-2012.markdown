For details, please review the [detailed change
log](http://code.google.com/p/psychtoolbox-3/source/detail?r=2434).

Improvements to Microsoft Kinect driver for all platforms:

-   Can now handle multiple Kinects simultaneously (untested).

-   PsychKinectCore(‘GetDepthImage’) now allows return of unprocessed
    raw sensor data in uint16 format, for fast disc writeout.
    Demonstrated in very sketchy KinectRawRecordingDemo.m.
