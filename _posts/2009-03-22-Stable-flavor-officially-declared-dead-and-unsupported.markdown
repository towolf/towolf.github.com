title: Stable is dead! Long live beta!
category: news

For the record: The Psychtoolbox flavor formerly known as `"stable"` is
hereby declared officially dead! We have renamed it to `unsupported` to
allow users with an interest in archeology or masochism to download it
under that new name. Hopefully the new name leaves no room for
interpretation about the level of support or sympathy you could expect
from us if you’d continue to use this flavor instead of letting it
r.i.p.

We have removed all references to it from the Wiki and current
downloader and have no intentions of ever touching it again for any
purpose. Actually we didn’t touch it for almost 2 years, so this is
nothing new. The `beta` flavor was always more current, reliable and bug
free than `stable` ever was.
