For details, please review the [detailed change
log](http://code.google.com/p/psychtoolbox-3/source/detail?r=2386).

The only changes in this release are performance improvements for
`GStreamer` movie playback functionality under Linux. We now detect if
the video decoder is multi-threading capable and enable multi-threaded
decoding, if so. This provides some speedup, e.g., with the
multi-threaded H264 decoder of the latest GStreamer versions, e.g.,
shipping with Ubuntu Linux 11.10. Some bits of additional performance
benchmarking code for video playback was added as well.

This is mostly useful for playback of high resolution HD video (1920 x
1080p HD) at unusually high framerates (e.g., 60 fps) on powerful
multi-core machines, e.g., 4 - 8 core high-end systems. Users of
dual-core systems will probably not notice any difference, as the old
Psychtoolbox was already able to saturate two processor cores. Also, for
more usual resolutions or framerates, there probably wonâ€™t be a big
benefit.

With this release, the Linux Psychtoolbox will probably significantly
outperform both the OS/X and Windows Psychtoolbox for demanding video
playback applications.
