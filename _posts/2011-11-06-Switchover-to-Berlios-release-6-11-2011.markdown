For details, please review the [detailed change
log](http://code.google.com/p/psychtoolbox-3/source/detail?r=2357).

With this beta update, we changed our hosting service for Psychtoolbox
from [Berlios](http://www.berlios.de) which is operated by the FOKUS
institute of the german Fraunhofer society to
[GoogleCode](http://code.google.com), operated by Google. This migration
was done because Berlios was about to shut down its operations by the
end of the year 2011 due to lack of funding. Now it seems that at least
Berlios basic services will be able to continue, maintained and funded
by a volunteer driven non-profit organization created for the purpose of
rescuing this great institution. Unfortunately these news came too late
for us.

Migration of existing Psychtoolbox installations from Berlios to Google
should happen automatically and mostly transparent for users during
regular Psychtoolbox updates and downloads.

Good bye Berlios, and thank you for five years of great service!

### Misc improvements, bug fixes, and new functions:
