s0 = ComputeDiffLimit\(pupil,nm\)

Compute the diffraction limit for coherent light.
\(For incoherent light the answer is 2\*s0.\)
See page 120 in Goodman.

    "pupil" diameter in mm
    "nm" is wavelength in nm
    "s0" is highest spatial frequency passed by the pupil in cycles/deg

Goodman, J. W. \(1968\) Introduction to Fourier Optics.
San Francisco: McGraw-Hill. Page 120.

Goodman's formula involves di, which I think is the distance to the
image. Goodman's formula gives the limit in
cycles/unit length.   The formula below gives
the answer in cycles/degree.
