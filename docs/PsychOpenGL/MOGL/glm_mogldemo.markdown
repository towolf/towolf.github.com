GLM\_MOGLDEMO  Demonstrate use of MATLAB-OpenGL toolbox independent of Psychtoolbox.

Instead of using Psychtoolbox as host environment, one can also use the built-in
glm - toolbox. It provides basic functions to open windows, swap buffers, collect
keyboard responses and such -- a minimalistic Psychtoolbox.
This demo demonstrates how to use MOGL with glm.

The GLM only works on MacOS-X whereas the Psychtoolbox approach works on
MacOS-X, GNU/Linux and M$-Windows.
