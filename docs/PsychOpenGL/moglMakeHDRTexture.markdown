textureId = moglMakeHDRTexture\(win, hdrImage \[, halffloat\]\[, poweroftwo\]\)

Create a high dynamic range Psychtoolbox texture from the given
Matlab/Octave high dynamic range image matrix 'hdrImage' and attach
it to the onscreen window 'win'.

Before calling this function you must have called [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('BeginOpenGL', win\);
with 'win' being the window handle for the onscreen window to
which the texture should be attached.

Returns a Psychtoolbox handle 'textureId' for the created 2D texture.
The texture can be used like any other Psychtoolbox texture, just
with the difference that it represents its color values with 32 bit
floating point precision or 16 bit half floating point precision
instead of 8 bpc fixed point precision.

The optional flag 'halffloat', if set to 1, will trigger creation of a
texture in half float format, ie. 16 bit floating point numbers instead
of 32 bit ones. This saves 50% memory and bandwidth. It also allows to
apply bilinear filtering during texture blits in hardware on GeForce 6000
and higher.

Normally, Psychtoolbox will try to select a GL\_TEXTURE\_RECTANGLE
texture if the hardware supports it. You can enforce creation of
a power-of-two GL\_TEXTURE\_2D by setting the optional 'poweroftwo'
flag to a value of 1.

'hdrImage' must be a \(height, width, 4\) matrix of type 'double' or
'single', where channel 1=Red, 2=Green, 3=Blue, 4=Alpha. The numeric
range \(0.0 - 1.0\) maps to \(minimum intensity - maximum intensity\).

If you want to use the created 2D texture for 3D OpenGL rendering
as well, you can use the [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('GetOpenGLTexture'\) function to
retrieve a standard OpenGL texture handle to it.

If you don't want to create a pure 2D texture, but a cube map texture
for use in 3D environment mapped lighting and such, then use the
function moglMakeGLHDRTexture\(\) instead. It can create cube-map
textures for use with the OpenGL functions. These are not useable
with the standard Psychtoolbox [Screen](/docs/Screen)\(\) commands.
