PLE "Print Last Error"  

ple prints the last error message issued by Matlab, including a complete  
backtrace of the call-sequence of functions that led to the error  
condition. Each line in the backtrace includes M-Filename and line number  
and allows you to open that file on the specified line by simply clicking  
on it with the mouse.  

ple is only supported on Matlab version 7 (Release 14 service pack 3) and later.  

Usage:  
ple     - Print last error, as contained in error structure '[psychlasterror](/docs/psychlasterror)'.  
ple(s)  - Print error and backtrace contained in error structure 's'.  

Copyright: This implementation of 'ple' is a slightly modified derivate of  
the original public domain implementation of ple.m by Malcolm Wood (the MathWorks).
