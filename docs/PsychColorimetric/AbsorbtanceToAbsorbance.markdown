[absorbanceSpectra, absorbanceSpectraWls] =...
  AbsorbtanceToAbsorbance(absorbtanceSpectra, absorbtanceSpectraWls, axialOpticalDensities, [NORMALIZE])

Obsolete.  Use AbsorptanceToAbsorbance, so that we can all learn to spell.

This will go away sooner or later, but is here now for backwards compatibility.
