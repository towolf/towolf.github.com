T = WlsToT\(wls,\[sd\]\)

Produce the identity color matching matrix associated
with the passed wavelength sampling.

Arguments may be either \[start delta n\] description or
a list of wavelenghts.

The second input sd is the standard deviation of a Gaussian
blur function which may be incorporated into the T matrix
if desired.

This second feature should be used with some
caution, as I haven't thought it completely through.  The
current implementation normalizes each row of T so that the
entries sum to 1.  This seems as if it is what we want to
get answers consistent with what we get when we don't
incorporate wavelength blurring.
