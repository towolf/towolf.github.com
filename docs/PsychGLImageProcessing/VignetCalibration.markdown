 s = VignetCalibration([filename] [, screenId])

 Vignetted Luminance calibration procedure for undistortion of distorted
 display luminance.

 This code was created by Jorrit S. Montijn of the Laboratoire Psychologie
 de la Perception at Universite Paris Descartes.

 This function allows the user to create a calibration for a vignetted
 luminance distortion. It enables the user to choose from either a
 Gaussian or Exponential approximation of the luminance vignetting. Users
 can change the position and steepness of the luminance fall-off in
 horizontal and vertical direction independently. It is also possible to
 adjust the minimal luminance.

 Once the calibration procedure is finished, the gain matrix (and other
 possibly useful parameters and variables) are saved to disk for use by a
 vignetting compensation program (see 'VignettingCorrectionDemo' for an
 example of how to do this).

#  How to use:

#  Start the script, providing a filename and screennumber:

 'filename' is the name of the file to which calibration results will be
 saved. If none is provided, a default name will be used. The default file
 will be stored in the directory returned by PsychtoolboxConfigDir('ShadingCalibration').

 'screenId' is the optional index of the screen that you want to
 calibrate. If only one screen is present, it is not necessary to include
 this parameter.

 When started, the program will show either a gaussian or exponential
 approximation of the required gain function. You can adjust the
 parameters so that the screen will look approximately isoluminant. It is
 recommended to use a photometer, since human eyes are far from perfect when
 doing this.

#  You can use the following keys to issue commands:

 Escape -   use this key to save and exit
 Tab        -   show/hide help text
 Space      -   change the parameter you wish to adjust
 '\<' and '\>'    -   use these keys to change the increment size of the
                    parameter adjustments
 Arrow Keys -   adjust parameters (depending on selected parameter)
