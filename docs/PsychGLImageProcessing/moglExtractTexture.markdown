moglExtractTexture(cmd [, arg1][, arg2][, ...]) - "MOGL Video texture extraction"


The algorithm makes heavy use of GPU based image processing for maximum
speed, so it needs at least NVidia Geforce 6000 series or ATI Radeon
X1000 series graphics hardware (and any later models or equivalent
hardware) to work. It also needs the PTB imaging pipeline enabled, at
least fast offscreen window support. You do this, e.g., by replacing a
call to ...

[win, winRect] = [Screen](/docs/Screen)('OpenWindow', screenid, 0);

... with a call sequence like this ...

PsychImaging('PrepareConfiguration');
PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseFastOffscreenWindows');
[win , winRect] = PsychImaging('OpenWindow', screenid, 0);



Subcommands, their syntax & meaning:
\====================================

[oldflag, oldgain] = moglExtractTexture('DebugFlag', flag [, debugGain]);
- Set debug flag to value 'flag'. Default is zero. Non-zero values enable
different visualizations that may aid debugging non-working setups. 1 =
Show silhouette buffer, 2 = Show trackbuffer, 3 = Show extracted texture.
A setting of -1 shows the real rendered image. A value of -2 disables any
kind of textual warnings.

The optional 'debugGain' parameter must be a 4 component [R G B A] color
vector with modulation gains for the drawn "debug images" - simply to
scale each color channel in intensity to allow for display of values
outside the standard displayable range between zero and one.


context = moglExtractTexture('CreateContext', window, rect, texCoordMin, texCoordMax, texResolution [,zThreshold=Off]);
- Create a "rendercontext" for a single 3D object. Returns a 'context'
handle to it which needs to be passed in to all other functions as
reference. All following parameters are required and don't have any
defaults:

'window' Handle of masterwindow - The onscreen window used for rendering.
This is not neccessarily the window to which final stimulus will be drawn
to, but it is needed as a "parent" for all ressources.

'rect' A Psychtoolbox rectangle [left top right bottom] that describes
the size and shape of the input video texture. This rect must have the
same size as the input video image textures -- Lots of internal
calculations depend on this geometry spec!

'texCoordMin' Two element vector which contains the minimum texture
coordinate values contained in the 3D scene for x- resp. y-direction.

'texCoordMax' Two element vector which contains the maximum texture
coordinate values contained in the 3D scene for x- resp. y-direction.

'texResolution' Two element vector which contains the internal resolution
for x- resp. y-direction of the 3D object surface. Higher values mean finer
resolution and less aliasing, but also higher storage requirements and
longer processing times. This defines the size of returned extracted
textures.

'zThreshold' Optional zThreshold for occlusion test: By default, it is
10\.0 ie. occlusion test disabled. A value between 0.0 and 1.0 will enable
occlusion testing -- Texels that would correspond to occluded surface patches are
not extracted. Small numbers (close to zero) make the test more sensitive but
can cause artifacts due to internal numeric roundoff errors. Bigger
numbers (closer to one) make it more robust but less powerful. The
"sweet-spot" depends on your hardware and 3D scene. Empirically a setting
of 0.0001 is a good value for ATI Radeon X1000 series hardware.
The default setting (bigger than 1.0) will disable occlusion test --
"Hidden texels" are not ignored, but updated with bogus extracted texture.


context = moglExtractTexture('SetRenderCallback', context, callbackEvalString);
- Define the 'eval' string for this context to be used as rendercallback.
Pass in a Matlab command string (for evaluation via eval() function in the
Workspace of the calling function). This string is called/executed during
each 'Update' cycle. It has to contain the code that performs the actual
rendering of the 3D scene or object.

The called rendering code \*must not\* glClear() the framebuffer or mess
around with alpha-blending state or depth-buffer/depth-test settings, nor
should it bind any shaders! It makes sense to disable any kind of
lighting or texture mapping, as no photorealistic image is rendered, so
it would be a waste of computation time.


context = moglExtractTexture('DestroyContext', context);
- Destroy a processing context, release all of its ressources.


[texBuffer, texId, texTarget] = moglExtractTexture('Extract', context, inputTexture [, newTexture = 0]);
- Perform an 'Extract' cycle for given context. A new "3D frame" is rendered
via the rendercallback function, then analysed, to provide the 3D surface
geometry and occlusion info and mapping for texture extraction. This info
is then used to extract pixel color values from the given video input
texture 'inputTexture' and the final extracted texturemap is stored
inside an internal texture buffer. A handle to that internal buffer
'texBuffer' is returned. The handle is owned by this function! You should
not close or otherwise mess with the provided buffer. You can read the
final texture from it, acquire a temporary OpenGL texture handle to it
for texture mapping, etc. You are even allowed to perform destructive
write informations on the buffer to change its pixel content. But do not
destory and reallocate the buffer, change its size, number of layers,
resolution or any other property! For your convenience, 'texId' and
'texTarget' also provide standard OpenGL handles to texture id and
target, associated with 'texBuffer'.

Alternatively you can set the optional flag 'newTexture' to a value of 1.
In that case, a new extracted texture 'texBuffer' is returned and you own
this texture, ie., you can do with it whatever you want and you are
responsible for releasing the texture via [Screen](/docs/Screen)('[Close](/docs/Close)', texBuffer);
once you are done with it.
