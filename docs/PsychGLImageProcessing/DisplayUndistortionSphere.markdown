Create geometric display calibration file for projection onto a sphere.

CAUTION: This function isn't properly implemented yet and will likely
not work for you as expected. Stay tuned...

This is just a wrapper around DisplayUndistortionHalfCylinder() which
does the actual work for both half-cylindrical and half-spherical
projection screens.
