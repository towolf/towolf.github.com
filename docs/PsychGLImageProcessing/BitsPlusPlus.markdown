BitsPlusPlus\(cmd \[, arg1\]\[, arg2, ...\]\) \-\- Psychtoolbox interface to
Cambridge Research Systems Bits\+\+ and Bits\# boxes for high precision
stimulus output to analog displays via 14 bit video converters.

This function is used to set up and interface with the Bits\+\+ / Bits\# box of
CRS. It is a Matlab wrapper around lower level GLSL Psychtoolbox
functions. This function depends on graphics hardware that supports the
Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline and framebuffers with more than 14 bit
precision, i.e., 16 bpc fixed point framebuffers or floating point
framebuffers. Have a look at the Psychtoolbox Wiki where you can find a
list of graphics cards with the neccessary features.

This function supersedes the old Matlab based Bits\+\+ Toolbox, which
essentially provides the same functionality on any graphics card, but is
harder to use, much slower and not fully integrated into PTB, ie, you
can't take full advantage of PTB's advanced drawing and image processing
functions when using the old Bits\+\+ toolbox.

See the help section about Bits\# for advanced Bits\# commands and how to
establish communication and convenient control for the Bits\# via USB
connection.

cmd \- The command that BitsPlusPlus should execute. cmd can be any of
the following:


Load a linear identity mapping CLUT into Bits\+\+ while running in Bits\+\+
mode:

BitsPlusPlus\('LoadIdentityClut', window\);

Will schedule update to an identity clut. Next invocation of
[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('[Flip](/docs/Flip)', window\); will actually upload the identity clut into
Bits\+\+.


# Schedule a Bits\+\+ DIO command for execution on next [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('[Flip](/docs/Flip)'\):

BitsPlusPlus\('DIOCommand', window, repetitions, mask, data, command \[, xpos, ypos\]\);

This will draw the proper T\-Lock control codes at positions \(xpos, ypos\)
for execution of the Bits\+\+ DIO commands \(mask, data, command\).

You can specify multiple codes at once: If mask, data, command, xpos and
ypos are matrices or vectors with 'num' rows, then each of the 'num' rows
defines one T\-Lock code. If mask, command, xpos and ypos are scalars and
data is a one row vector, then only the corresponding T\-Lock line is
drawn.

For each DIO command:
'mask' must be a 8 bit integer value, 'command' must be a 8 bit integer
value, whereas 'data' must be a a 248 element row vector of bytes.

Consult your Bits\+\+ manual for explanation of the meaning of the values.

xpos and ypos are optional: By default, the T\-Lock code is drawn into the
3rd pixel row of the output image, so it can't collide with a potential
T\-Lock code for CLUT updates.

The DIO command will become effective during the next flip command. The
T\-Lock code is drawn during 'repetitions' successive invocations of
[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('[Flip](/docs/Flip)'\). If you set 'repetitions' to \-1, then the code will be
drawn until you stop it via a call to BitsPlusPlus\('DIOCommandReset', window\);


# Disable use of the DIO T\-Lock code blitting:

BitsPlusPlus\('DIOCommandReset', window\);
Stops blitting of T\-Lock command codes immediately. If you want to use
them again, you have to respecify codes via the BitsPlusPlus\('DIOCommand',...\);




Open a full\-screen window on the Bits\+\+ display as with
[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('OpenWindow', ...\), perform all initialization:

The following commands will execute [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('OpenWindow'\) with all proper
parameters, followed by Bits\+\+ init routines. They are completely sufficient
drop in replacements for [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('OpenWindow'\), accepting and returning
exactly the same arguments that [Screen](/docs/Screen)\(\) would do, adjusting all
parameters to the constraints of the Bits\+\+, if necessary.

# Activate Bits\+\+ mode:

\[win, winRect\] = BitsPlusPlus\('OpenWindowBits\+\+', screenid, ...\);

This will open an onscreen window on Bits\+\+ screen 'screenid' with a
standard 8 bits per color channel framebuffer. The gamma table of your
graphics hardware will be loaded with an identity gamma table, so the
T\-Lock system of Bits\+\+ works and Bits\+\+ can accept commmands embedded
into the stimulus images. Psychtoolbox will automatically embed a T\-Lock
control line into the top line of the display screen, which encodes the
256 entry, 14 bit per color channel CLUT to use for Bits\+\+ display mode.
You can change the Bits\+\+ CLUT at any time via the standard PTB
[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('LoadNormalizedGammaTable', win, newclut, 2\); command. The
'newclut' will get uploaded to the Bits\+\+ at the next invocation of
[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('[Flip](/docs/Flip)'\) to allow updates of the CLUT synchronous to stimulus
updates. 'newclut' has to be a 256 rows by 3 columns matrix with values
in range 0.0 \- 1.0: 0.0 is mapped to clut color value 0, 1.0 is mapped to
the highest Bits\+\+ output color value 16383.

This mode works on any OpenGL graphics hardware.


# Activate Mono\+\+ mode:

\[win, winRect\] = BitsPlusPlus\('OpenWindowMono\+\+', screenid, ...\);

This will open an onscreen window on Bits\+\+ screen 'screenid' for display
of pure luminance \(grayscale\) images. The framebuffer has a resolution of
32 bit floating point precision by default: This means that pixel luminance
values have to be specified as floating point numbers between 0.0 and
1.0. 0.0 maps to black \(Output intensity 0 on Bits\+\+ device\). 1.0 maps to
white \(Maximum output intensity 16383 on Bits\+\+ device\). The intensity
range between 0.0 and 1.0 is internally represented and processed by
Psychtoolbox with a resolution 23 bits, i.e. over 8 million levels of
luminance. The Bits\+\+ can resolve this range to 14 bits, ie. 16384 levels
of luminance during display. This mode is not compatible with the use of
any gamma\- or clut\- tables. Both the graphics hardwares gamma table and
the Bits\+\+ internal clut are set to an identity mapping while this mode
is active. Please read the notes below the Color\+\+ section for graphics
hardware requirements and other useful tips for use of Bits\+\+.

If you call this subfunction as 'OpenWindowMono\+\+WithOverlay', the
overlay plane of Bits\+\+ gets enabled and an additional overlay window is
created for drawing the image for that overlay plane.

\[overlaywin, overlaywinRect\] = BitsPlusPlus\('GetOverlayWindow', win\);
\- Will return the handle to the 'overlaywin'dow associated with the
onscreen luminance window:

  'overlayWin' is the handle to the overlay window associated with the
  overlay of onscreen window 'win'. The overlay window is a standard
  offscreen window, so you can do anything with it that you would want to
  do with offscreen windows. The only difference is that the window is a
  pure index window: It only has one "color channel", which can be written
  with color values between 0 and 255. Values 1 to 255 get mapped to the
  corresponding color indices of the Bits\+\+ overlay plane: A zero value is
  transparent \-\- Content of the onscreen window is visible. Positive
  non\-zero color values map to the 255 indices available in overlay mode,
  these get mapped by the Bits\+\+ CLUT to colors. You can define the
  mapping of indices to CLUT colors via the
  [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('LoadNormalizedGammaTable', win, clut, 2\); command.

  Updates of the overlay image are synchronized to [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('[Flip](/docs/Flip)'\)
  updates. If you draw into the overlay window, the changed overlay image
  will become visible at [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('[Flip](/docs/Flip)'\) time \-\- in sync with the changed
  onscreen window content. The overlay plane is not automatically cleared
  to background \(or transparent\) color after a flip, but its content
  persists across flips. You need to clear it out manually via a
  [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('FillRect'\) command.


# Activate Color\+\+ mode:

\[win, winRect\] = BitsPlusPlus\('OpenWindowColor\+\+', screenid, ...\);

This will open an onscreen window on Bits\+\+ screen 'screenid' for display
of 14 bit per color component 42bpp color images. The framebuffer has
a resolution of 32 bit floating point precision for each color component
by default: This means that \(Red, Green, Blue\) color pixel component
values have to be specified as floating point numbers between 0.0 and
1.0. 0.0 maps to minimum output intensity on Bits\+\+ device for a channel.
1.0 maps to maximum output intensity 16383 on Bits\+\+ device for a channel.
The color intensity range between 0.0 and 1.0 is internally represented and
processed by Psychtoolbox with an effective resolution of about 23 bits,
i.e. over 8 million levels of color per color channel. The Bits\+\+ can resolve
this range to 14 bits, ie. 16384 levels of color during display. This mode
is not compatible with the use of any gamma\- or clut\- tables. Both the graphics
hardwares gamma table and the Bits\+\+ internal clut are set to an identity
mapping while this mode is active. Please read the notes below for graphics
hardware requirements and other useful tips for use of Bits\+\+.


If you use Color\+\+ mode, you must call
BitsPlusPlus\('SetColorConversionMode', mode\); first to select the mode
for sampling the framebuffer and converting into output color values. See
the respective section of "help PsychImaging" for 'Color\+\+' or
'EnableDataPixxC48Output' mode for the Bits\+ or Datapixx device for an
explanation of this mandatory parameter. The setting before 22nd
September 2010 for all PTB\-3 versions was 0 \(==zero\).

You can query the mode for an onscreen window 'win' by a call to:
mode = BitsPlusPlus\('GetColorConversionMode', win\);


# Notes for both Mono\+\+ and Color\+\+ mode:

In Mono\+\+ and Color\+\+ mode, PTB expects color values in the range 0.0 to
1.0 instead of the \(otherwise usual\) range 0 to 255. The range 0.0\-1.0
is a more natural fit for high dynamic range/precision output devices than
the 0\-255 range with its strong ties to 8 bpc output devices. 0\-1 is also
the "natural" native color range of OpenGL, so colors in this range can
be handled by the graphics hardware at a higher speed. You can change the
mapping of input colors to output intensities by use of the command
[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('ColorRange'\) \(see its online help for usage\), but in the interest
of uniform code and to avoid possible side effects with some graphics
hardware, we strongly recommend using the default 0.0\-1.0 color range.

You can still pass standard 8bpc \(256 color/intensity levels\) color/luminance
textures to PTB via standard use of [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('MakeTexture'\) \- the hardware
will convert such 8bpc images to OpenGL's native color range, as well as
any images delivered by the Quicktime movie playback engine or the video
capture engine. If you want to provide high dynamic range, high color
depths images, please specify them as Matlab double matrices to
[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('MakeTexture'\) and set the optional flag 'floatprecision' to 1 or
2, i.e., hdrtex = [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('MakeTexture', win, myHDRImage, \[\], \[\], 2\);

Psychtoolbox will represent such images with an internal precision of 10
bits \+ 1 bit sign if you choose the 'floatprecision' flag to be 1. If you
choose a 'floatprecision' flag of 2, PTB will represent the images with
an internal precision of 23 bits \+ 1 bit sign. You can provide negative
color values as well, e.g., \-0.5. If you wonder what the use of this
might be, have a careful look at the tutorial script...
'AdditiveBlendingForLinearSuperpositionTutorial.m'
... for an example of extremely fast drawing of luminance gratings with
controllable size, orientation and contrast and correct linear superposition:

By default, PTB will use a 32\-bit floating point framebuffer for your
drawings, ie. the precision is way higher than needed for any high
dynamic range/resolution display device in existence. The downside of this
super\-precision is that alpha\-blending is not supported in this mode, unless
you employ an NVidia Geforce 8000 series \(and later\) graphics card, or a
ATI Radeon HD2000/3000 series graphics card \(and later\). If you need
alpha\-blending on older/other hardware then specify the optional flag
'kPsychNeed16BPCFloat' for the 'imagingmode' argument. This will reduce
effective accuracy of the framebuffer to 10 bit precision, but allow for
fast alpha\-blending. 10 Bit precision are 4 bits less than the 14 bits
that Bits\+\+ can provide, but it will be possible to use the extra 14\-10 =
4 bits for gamma correction of the display by employing a gamma
correction shader.

# Gamma\- and color correction:

In Mono\+\+ and Color\+\+ mode, the hardware gamma tables of your graphics
card and the Bits\+ box can't be used for gamma\- or color correction.
However, PTB provides a much more powerful and flexible color correction
system for this purpose. See "help PsychColorCorrection" for further
explanation and usage examples for standard gamma correction.

Graphics hardware requirements: Mono\+\+ and Color\+\+ mode require use of the
Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline and floating point framebuffers. The
minimum requirements are ATI Radeon X1000 series or NVidia Geforce\-6800
series and later graphics hardware. We currently recommend NVidia
Geforce\-8000 series or ATI Radeon HD\-2000/3000 hardware for best results.
However, this functions have been successfully tested on ATI Radeon X1600
and NVidia Geforce\-7800 hardware as well.

All Bits\+\+ modes supported by this function should work Plug & Play,
requiring no changes to your stimulus code other than mentioned here to
take full advantage of all functionality of Psychtoolbox just as with standard
8 bpc displays at the higher 14 bpc quality of Bits\+\+. If you find this
not to be the case then it's either an omission in our documentation
or a bug \- Please report it.


# BITS\# specific functions:

A Bits\# device which is connected via USB will show up as an additional
serial port on the system. This driver will communicate with the Bits\#
by establishing a serial port connection to the device via that serial
port. Presence of a Bits\# can be signalled by either calling the BitsPlusPlus\('OpenBits\#'\)
function, passing a serial port device spec 'portSpec', or just by calling
BitsPlusPlus\('OpenBits\#'\) without any parameters. In the latter case, the
driver will check for the existence of a configuration file named...
\[PsychtoolboxConfigDir 'BitsSharpConfig.txt'\] . Presence of the file means
to use a Bits\# device, absence means to treat any device as a Bits\+ device.
Presence of a serial port device file name in the first line of that text
configuration file will use the serial port device with that name for
communication, otherwise the driver will try to auto\-detect the proper
serial port for communication.


rc = BitsPlusPlus\('OpenBits\#' \[, portSpec\]\);
\-\- Open a serial port control connection to a connected Bits\# device.
The 'portSpec' parameter is optional and defines the name of the serial
port\(\-device file\) to use for the connection. If omitted, the name will
be taken from a configuration file, or auto\-detected. This function must
be called before use of any Bits\# specific functions, otherwise they'll turn
into  no\-ops or failures. This function can be called multiple times. It will
only open the connection on first call. Successive calls will do nothing but
increment a reference count of clients to the device.


rc = BitsPlusPlus\('[Close](/docs/Close)'\);
\-\- Decrement reference count to a Bits\# device, close the serial connection
to it once the count drops to zero, ie., as soon as nobody is using the
connection anymore.


rc = BitsPlusPlus\('ResetOnWindowClose'\);
\-\- Like '[Close](/docs/Close)', but switch display back to Bits\+\+ video mode first, as
that mode is "GUI friendly". Usually automatically called from [Screen](/docs/Screen)\(\)
when the Bits\# stimulation onscreen window gets closed, at least if you
used PsychImaging\(\) to control the device.


rc = BitsPlusPlus\('CheckGPUSanity', window, xoffset \[, injectFault=0\]\);
\-\- Perform online\-test of GPU identity gamma tables and DVI\-D display
encoders. Try to correct problems with wrong identity gamma tables and at
least detect problems with \(spatio\-\)temporal display dithering. Returns
rc == 0 on full success, rc \> 0 on failure.
If the optional 'injectFault' parameter is set to 1, then an intentionally
perturbed gamma table is loaded into the gpu to test how well the gamma table
tweaking code is able to recover from wrong tables.


pixels = BitsPlusPlus\('GetVideoLine', nrPixels, scanline\);
\-\- Return the first \(left\-most\) 'nrPixels' pixels in video scanline
'scanline' of the video display driven by a Bits\# device. 'pixels' is
a uint8 matrix with three rows for red, green and blue pixel color values,
and 'nrPixels' columns, the three elements of each column encoding the
r,g,b color values of the pixel corresponding to that column \(x\-position\)
of the scanline \(y\-position\). Values are read back via the USB\-Serial
connection from the Bits\# and the device sends back the pixel data as
received over the DVI\-D link.


BitsPlusPlus\('SwitchToBits\+\+'\);
\-\- Switch Bits\# to Bits\+\+ mode.


BitsPlusPlus\('SwitchToMono\+\+'\);
\-\- Switch Bits\# to Mono\+\+ mode.


BitsPlusPlus\('SwitchToColor\+\+'\);
\-\- Switch Bits\# to Color\+\+ mode.


BitsPlusPlus\('SwitchToStatusScreen'\);
\-\- Switch Bits\# to Status screen display.


BitsPlusPlus\('MassStorageMode'\);
\-\- Switch Bits\# to MassStorageMode. This will forcefully close allow
client connections to the device, close the USB serial port connection
and close the driver. The Bits\# will report into USB mass storage mode,
where it can get accessed like a USB flash drive, e.g., to edit configuration
files, update firmware or EDID's etc. Only a power\-cycle will bring the
device back into a mode which allows us to connect to it again.
