Create geometric display calibration file for projection onto a cylinder or sphere.

CAUTION: This function is not fully implemented and tested\! It may or
may not work for your purpose and may give totally wrong results.

# Usage:

DisplayUndistortionHalfCylinder\(\[calibfilename\]\[, screenid\]\);

Prepare display calibration file for projection of a flat screen image to
a half-cylindrical projection surface.

The script displays a calibration grid on screen 'screenid' \(or the
auto-selected screen if this parameter is omitted\). Use the keys
mentioned below to modify the grid until it is optimally aligned with
your cylindrical projection surface. Save the final calibration settings
to file 'calibfilename' \(or an auto-selected default filename, if
parameter is omitted\) by pressing the 's' key. Exit the procedure via
pressing the ESCape key.

The saved calibration file can be later loaded and applied in a script
via the command sequence that this script will diplay when it is
finished.


Keys and their meaning:
ESCape = Quit script. Unsaved changes will be lost\!
s      = Save current settings in calibration file.
r      = Change rotation angle.
t      = Change translation of output image.
o      = Change size of output image.
i      = Change size of input image.
w      = Width of the projection area at a radius distance R in cm for
         sphere curvature correction.
b      = Radius of the spherical projection screen for sphere curvature correction.

-\> Type "edit SphereProjectionShader.frag.txt" and look at the warp
shader code for a full understanding of the roff and rpow coefficients
for spherical remapping. Also see Psychtoolbox forum message 11660.


Arrow keys change the parameter that is selected via 'r', 't', 'o' or 'i'
key.
