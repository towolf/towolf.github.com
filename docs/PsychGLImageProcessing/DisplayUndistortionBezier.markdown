DisplayUndistortionBezier([caliboutfilename] [, xnum=2][, ynum=2][, subdivision=100][, imagename=default][, screenid=max][, stereomode=0][, winrect=[]][, calibinfilename][, refimagename])

Geometric display calibration procedure for geometric undistortion of
distorted displays. Needs graphics hardware with support for PTB imaging
pipeline.

IMPORTANT: While this routine is easy to use, it is also limited! The
Banks Vision Lab (University of California, Berkeley) has contributed a
much more powerful and flexible calibration procedure.

Read "help DisplayUndistortionBVL" for help and info on that one.


Many display devices, e.g., video beamers and most CRT displays, cause
some amount of spatial distortion to your visual stimuli during display.
Psychtoolbox can "undistort" your visual stimuli for you: At stimulus
onset time, PTB applies a geometric warping transformation to your
stimulus which is meant to counteract or cancel out the geometric
distortion caused by your display device. If both PTB's warp transform
and the distortion transform of the display match, your stimulus will
show up undistorted on the display device.

# For this to work, PTB needs two things:

1\. Recent graphics hardware with support for the PTB imaging pipeline:
See our Wiki for recommendations. However, all ATI cards starting with
Radeon 9500 and all NVidia cards of type GeForce-FX5200 and later, as
well as the Intel-GMA 950 and later should be able to do it, although
more recent cards will have a higher performance.

2\. A calibration file that defines the warp transformation to apply. Your
experiment script will load that file into [Screen](/docs/Screen)'s "warp engine" at the
beginning of your experiment.

This routine allows you to create such a calibration file in an
interactive procedure: It applies some warp transformation, shows the
result on your display, and you can change and tweak the transformation
until it fits your needs, ie. it nicely undistorts your display. Then the
corresponding calibration file is saved for later use with that display.

As the name suggests, DisplayUndistortionBezier supports a continous
mapping (x', y') = Beziersurface(x, y) from input pixel locations (x,y)
in your stimulus image to output locations (x', y') on your display. This
mapping is defined by a Bezier surface (see Chapter 12 "Evaluators and
NURBS" or any other textbook about NURBS for a description of their
mathematical properties).

The shape of the Bezier surface is defined by the location of a couple of
control points, which you can move around during the calibration
procedure to modify the shape of the surface. You can select the number
of control points to use: More control points (=degrees of freedom) allow
for more flexibility and finer control, but make the calibration procedure
more tedious for you. Their number doesn't affect computation time when
your experiment script is running.

# How to use:

1\. Start the script, providing all parameters that you don't want to have
at default settings (all parameters have defaults):

'caliboutfilename' Name of the file to which calibration results should
be stored. Defaults to 'BezierCalibdata.mat' in your current working directory.

'xnum' and 'ynum' Number of horizontal and vertical control points to
use. Higher numbers mean finer and more flexible control, but also a more
tedious calibration for you. Their number doesn't affect runtime
behaviour of your stimulus script. For simple trapezoid correction or
translation/rotation, the minimum allowed number of control points xnum=2
and ynum=2 is sufficient - this is the default. For most other purposes
a 3 by 3 grid of control points xnum=3 and ynum=3 may suffice. However,
you are not limited by any upper bound...

'subdivision' Number of vertical and horizontal subdivisions of the
bezier surface - the grid resolution: Higher numbers mean higher accuracy
but also higher computational overhead in your script. However, recent
graphics hardware shouldn't have much problems handling reasonably sized
meshes. Defaults to a 100 by 100 grid.

'imagename' Name of the image file for the test image to be rendered as
an alternative to the mesh grid. We default to our standard 'konintjes'
image.

'screenid' screen id of the target display for calibration.
max([Screen](/docs/Screen)('Screens')) by default.

'stereomode' Stereomode for which calibration should be applied: Defaults
to 0 == Mono mode. [6 1] would mean: "Use stereomode 6 (Anaglyph stereo)
and the right-eye view (1)".

'winrect' Size of the calibration window: Defaults to full-screen.

'calibinfilename' Defaults to none. If provided, results of a previous
calibration are loaded from file 'calibinfilename' instead of starting
from scratch. Useful for incremental calibration.

2\. After startup, the script will display a grid onscreen, which
represents the displayed area after calibration. Your job is to tweak,
shift and bend that grid so that it looks as flat and rectilinear as
possible on your display from the viewpoint of your subject. The grid has
green control points placed at regular intervals. These are the tweakable
points that you can move: Moving these control points will bend the
calibration grid in a smooth fashion, as if the grid would be attached to
the points with some springs.

# Mouse operation:

To select a control point, just move the mouse pointer close to it, then
press a mouse key. The selected control point will change color to yellow
and a yellow line will connect its current position to its original
position in the uncalibrated display.

You can move the point by moving the mouse pointer while keeping the
mouse key pressed.


# Keys and their meaning:

You can also move the currently selected control point via the Cursor
keys, at slow speed, or at a faster speed when holding down the shift
key.

Press the 'space' key to toggle between grid display and display of the
test image 'imagename'. A good way to test the calibration would be to
load a screenshot of one of your typical stimuli as image file
'imagename'.

You finish the calibration and write it into a calibration file by
pressing the ESCape key. This will end the calibration script.
