[versionString, versionStructure]=PsychtoolboxVersion

Return a string identifying this release of the Psychtoolbox.
The first three numbers identify the base version of Psychtoolbox:

- Leftmost: Increments indicate a disruptive change in the feature
set and design of the software, by abrupt introduction of design changes.
This should never happen, as this would mean a completely new product,
entirely incompatible with the old software.

- Middle: Increments indicate significant enhancements or changes in
functionality. This will usually only happen every couple of years at
most.

- Rightmost: A counter to distinguish multiple releases having the same
leftmost and middle version numbers. This happens if there are backwards
incompatible changes to the programming interface or functionality which
may require code adjustments in user code. It also happens if we cancel
support for platforms (Matlab/Octave versions, operating system versions,
processor architectures etc.). This happens occassionally.

Numeric values of the three integer fields contained in versionString are
available in fields of the second return argument, "versionStructure".

# The field 'Flavor' defines the subtype of Psychtoolbox being used:

\* beta: An experimental release that is already tested by the developers,
but not yet sufficiently tested or proven in the field. Beta releases
contain lots of new and experimental features that may be useful to you
but that may change slightly in behaviour or syntax in the final release,
making it necessary for you to adapt your code after a software update.
Beta releases are known to be imperfect and fixing bugs in them is not a
high priority.  The term 'current' is a synonym for 'beta'. Beta releases
are the only releases we provide at this point.

\* trunk: Development prototypes, for testing and debugging by developers
and really adventuruous users, not for production use!

\* Psychtoolbox-x.y.z: Old, no longer supported Psychtoolbox versions.

\* Debian package: A Psychtoolbox provided by GNU/Debian or NeuroDebian.

The revision number and the provided URL allows you to visit the developer
website in the Internet and get direct access to all development logs
regarding your working copy of Psychtoolbox.

Be aware that execution of the PsychtoolboxVersion command can take a
lot of time (in the order of multiple seconds to 1 minute).

Most Psychtoolbox mex files now provide a built-in 'Version' command
which returns version for themselves.  The version string for the
built-in version numbers contains a fourth numeric field named "build".
The build number is a unique serial number.  Mex files distinquished only
by build numbers were compiled from identical C source files.
