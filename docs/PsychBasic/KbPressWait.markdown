\[secs, keyCode, deltaSecs\] = KbPressWait\(\[deviceNumber\]\[, untilTime=inf\]\[, more optional args for KbWait\]\);

KbPressWait waits for a single key press of your subject, ie. it waits
until all keys on the keyboard are released, after that it waits for a
a press of a key, then it returns the keyboard state and timestamp of the key
press \*without\* waiting for the key press to finish ie, without waiting for
a key release.

It also returns if the optional deadline 'untilTime' is reached.

This is a convenience wrapper, doing the same thing as
KbWait\(deviceNumber, 2, ...\); so read "help KbWait" for details about
operation and returned values.

You'll typically use this function to ask your subject for a response and
you want to continue your script immediately without delay, even if the
subject keeps the key pressed for a while \-\- a typical usage would be if
you want to change the stimulus immediately after response, eg, blank the
display etc.
