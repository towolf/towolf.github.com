BitsPlusPlusTLockBlitterTest([screenId])

Test if the old style Bits++ T-Lock code generation and the new style
built-in T-Lock code generation yield identical results.

'screenId' == Display screen to test. Defaults to max([Screen](/docs/Screen)('Screens')).

This test should pass on all graphics hardware. If it fails on some
setup, we're interested in hearing from you.
