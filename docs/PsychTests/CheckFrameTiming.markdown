 [times, badOut, misses]=CheckFrameTiming([rectSize=128][, scale=1][, dur=30][, thresh=0.05][, runPriority=MaxPriority('KbCheck')][, useWhen=0][,useDrawingFinished=1])

 based on FastMaskedNoiseDemo, CheckFrameTiming collects and displays
 timing info

 rectSize = Size of the generated random noise image: rectSize by rectSize
            pixels. This is also the size of the Psychtoolbox noise
            texture.

 scale = Scalefactor to apply to texture during drawing: E.g. if you'd set
         scale = 2, then each noise pixel would be replicated to draw an image
         that is twice the width and height of the input noise image. In this
         demo, a nearest neighbour filter is applied, i.e., pixels are just
         replicated, not bilinearly filtered -- Important to preserve statistical
         independence of the random pixel values!

 dur   = seconds to display

 thresh = percent deviation to report as a miss (specify 5% as 0.05)

 runPriority = the priority at which to run

 useWhen = 0 for no when parameter sent to [Screen](/docs/Screen)('[Flip](/docs/Flip)') (seems to give
           better timing.  any other value sends lastVbl + .5\*ifi

 useDrawingFinished = 0 to use [Screen](/docs/Screen)('DrawingFinished'). mario's comment
                      suggets it may slow thigns down, but edf thinks it is supposed to speed
                      things up and only printing its return value would slow things down.

return vals:
times is a vector of inter-vbl-times as measured by [Screen](/docs/Screen)('[Flip](/docs/Flip)')
badOut is 3 x N, with one column for each frame whose time deviates by more than thresh % from the ifi
   row 1 is the frame number
   row 2 is the measured frame time
   row 3 is the % deviation from ifi
misses are the frame numbers that [Screen](/docs/Screen)('[Flip](/docs/Flip)') noticed it missed
