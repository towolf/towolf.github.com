QuestTest.m

Created by hacking a copy of QuestDemo.m, in order to
do some simulations for Beau Watson.

128 repetitions of each condition
Quest assumes LogWeibull psychometric function with parameters:
beta = \{1.5, 2., 2.5, 3., 3.5, 4., 4.5, 5., 5.5\} \(in separate conditions\)
gamma = 0.03
delta = .01
sample range = \{\-30,30\} dB
sample step size 0.5 dB
Prior is always Gaussian, sd=12 dB, centered on guess.
Initial guess drawn from Normal distribution with mean 0 and sd=6 dB.
Quest uses mode of posterior density.
Simulated observer has LogWeibull psychometric function with parameters:
\{beta=3.5,gamma=.03,delta=.01\}


By commenting and uncommenting five lines below, you can use
this file to implement three QUEST\-related procedures for measuring
threshold.

QuestMode: In the original algorithm of Watson & Pelli \(1983\)
each trial and the final estimate are at the MODE of the posterior pdf.

QuestMean: In the improved algorithm of King\-Smith et al. \(1994\).
each trial and the final estimate are at the MEAN of the posterior pdf.

QuestQuantile & QuestMean: In the ideal algorithm of Pelli \(1987\)
each trial is at the best QUANTILE, and the final estimate is at
the MEAN of the posterior pdf.
