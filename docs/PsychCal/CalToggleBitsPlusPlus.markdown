CalToggleBitsPlusPlus(enableBitsPP)
  This function toggles the use of Bits++ in the calibration functions.
  Currently, this is only a temporary way of doing things until the Bits++
  code built into [Screen](/docs/Screen) is tested more.

  'enableBitsPP' is a true/false value that turns on/off Bits++
  functionality in the Calibrate functions.
