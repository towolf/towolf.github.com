cal = CalibrateFitYoked\(cal\)

Fit the gamma data from the yoked measurements.

This has to do with Brainard lab HDR display calibration procedures
and doesn't do anything unless some special fields exist
in the calibration structure.  It's in the PTB because when we use
it, we want to call it from script RefitCalGamma, and that one does
belong in the PTB.
