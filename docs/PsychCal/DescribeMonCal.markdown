same = DescribeMonCal(cal,[file],[whichScreen])

Print descriptive information about a calibration
to the command window or file.

Argument file is a standard Matlab file descriptor,
see fopen.  If file arg is omitted or empty, printout
goes to command window.

If argument whichScreen is passed, a description of
the current hardware is also printed.  In this case,
returned boolean same indicates whether the calibration
is consistent with the current hardware.  Boolean
same is empty if whichScreen is not provided.
