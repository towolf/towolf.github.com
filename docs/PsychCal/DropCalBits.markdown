cal = DropCalBits(cal,whichScreen,[forceBit])  

Drops the bitdepth of a calibration file if  
necessary.  Useful for running programs  
transparently on 8 and 10 bit hardware.  

If arg forceBits is passed, it is used as  
the current hardware depth.  Otherwise the  
reported DACBits of whichScreen is used.  

This code assumes calibration was done at  
equally spaced levels in RGB settings, as is  
the case with our calibration routines.  May  
not generalize, and I haven't worried about  
the roundoff errors.  Certainly OK for basic  
use.
