Switch PTB's onscreen window into a display mode suitable for easy debugging on single\-screen setups.

This function allows to setup [Screen](/docs/Screen) onscreen windows to be
partially transparent, so one can simultaneously see the stimulus display and
the Matlab window and other GUI windows.

Usage: PsychDebugWindowConfiguration\(\[opaqueForHID=0\]\[, opacity=0.5\]\)

To enable: Call PsychDebugWindowConfiguration before the [Screen](/docs/Screen)\('OpenWindow',...\) call\!
To disable: Type "clear [Screen](/docs/Screen)" or "clear all".

The optional parameter 'opaqueForHID' if set to a non\-zero value will
disallow mouse clicks and other mouse actions to "get through" to the
GUI, ie., it will make the onscreen window opaque to the mouse pointer.

A setting of \-1 will disable the transparency again, but \*keep all timing tests
and timestamping disabled\*.

The optional parameter 'opacity' controls how opaque the onscreen window
is, in a range of 0.0 to 1.0 for 0% to 100% opacity. By default the
window is 50% opaque \(or 50% transparent if you like\).

Stimulus onset timing and timestamping will be inaccurate in this mode
and graphics performance will be reduced\! Don't use for timing tests or
during real experiment sessions\!

This feature will only work reliably \- or at all \- if your operating
system is running with a compositing window manager installed and
enabled. This is the case for Windows Vista, Windows\-7/8 and later MS
operating systems, as well as MacOS/X, and most GNU/Linux distributions
which have a compositing desktop installed and enabled, e.g., KDE,
GNOME\-2/3, Compiz, Unity.

Keyboard and mouse input may not work as expected under all conditions,
i.e., it may by impaired in either Psychtoolbox, or for the other running
applications. Good luck\!
