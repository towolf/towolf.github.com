[val\_UWattsPerCm2,limit\_UWattsPerCm2] = ISO2007MPEComputeType1ContinuousAntConvrgUnweightedValue(S,irradiance\_uWattsPerCm2,stimulusDurationSecs)

Compute the unweighted radiation for anterior segment convergent beam value, for Type 1 instruments as given on page 8, Table 2,
5\.4.1.5.  This limit applies only to convergent beams, whatever they are.  I'm guessing this is what a Maxwellian view produces,
however, as in that case the beam is brought to a waist inside the eye.  In this case, the limit applies to the irradiance
at the beam waist over the 1 mm diameter aperture with the highest irradiance.

Unlike all the other routines in this suite, the key quantity is probably not best passed as stimulus radiance.  Rather, for
this type of optical system, the relevant irradiance should be measured directly.

NOTE: This routine has not been tested, since I (DHB) don't have any instrument currently that produces the relevant type of
stimulus.  I added it as a placeholder for convenience.  There is an error statement to keep it from being used
until it is tested.

Input spectrum is radiance in units of UWatts/[m2-wlinterval].

Also return the exposure limit for this quantity.

See page 6 for a definition of a Type 1 instrument.  As far as I can tell, the key
criterion is that it doesn't put out more light that exceeds the Type 1 limits.

If the exposure time is longer than 2 hours the specified limits should be reduced by
1/exposureDuration in hours.  This routine implements that adjustment for its returned
limit value.  It does not implement a further reduction of of the limit (by a factor of 2)
for microscopes and endoilluminators.
