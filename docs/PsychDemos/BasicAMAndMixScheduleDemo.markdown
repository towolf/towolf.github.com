Demonstrates basic use of sound schedules, volume controls, amplitude
modulation and audio mixing of multiple voices.

Usage: BasicAMAndMixScheduleDemo;

For more advanced or different use of sound schedules see
BasicSoundScheduleDemo. For more advanced use of mixing, modulators and
other stuff see BasicMultiTrackAudioRecorderDemo.

This demo shows how to use master-slave audio devices to playback with
multiple voices, mixing multiple sounds together. It shows how to
manually control the per-slave volume and master volume. It shows how to
apply AM amplitude modulation to the different slave audio devices, and how
to synchronize different devices and AM modulation. It also shows use of
sound schedules to implement repetitive sound sequences with precise
timing between different sounds.
