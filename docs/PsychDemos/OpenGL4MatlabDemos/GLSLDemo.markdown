GLSLDemo - Demonstrate use of the GLSL OpenGL Shading language in the
Psychtoolbox.

The OpenGL shading language \(GLSL\) allows to write specialized programs
which are uploaded into the graphics hardware itself. These programs
are then executed very efficiently in the grahpics hardware. So called
Vertex-Shaders are executed on a per-vertex basis. They calculate and
manipulate per-vertex properties, e.g., displacement, color, normal
vectors. So called Fragment-Shaders are executed for each single fragment
or pixel that is drawn into the backbuffer. They allow, e.g., to implement
your own lighting model or perform image processing on your image.

GLSL programs are very similar in their syntax to the C programming language,
its basically C, extended by functions for matrix and vector math and for
typical graphics purpose.

A specific piece of graphics hardware may only support either vertex-shaders,
or fragment-shaders or none at all, as these features are pretty new in the
world of computer-graphics, so this demo may not run at all or at least some
shaders will either fail or give unexpected results. If you want to make
use of GLSL you'll need to equip your computer with up to date graphics
hardware.

This demo loads a collection of shaders. It applies the shaders to a
collection of objects, demonstrating some visual effects. This is early
beta code, so don't expect too much. It mostly demonstrates how to get
started with shader-programming in Psychtoolbox.

Press the 'n' key to toggle between different objects.
Press the SPACE key to toggle between the different shaders.
Stop the demo by pressing any other key.
