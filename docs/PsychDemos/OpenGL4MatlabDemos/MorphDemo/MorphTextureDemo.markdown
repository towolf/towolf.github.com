function MorphTextureDemo\(\[dotson\]\[, normalson\]\[,stereomode\]\[, usefastoffscreenwindows\]\)

MorphTextureDemo \-\- Demonstrates use of "[moglmorpher](/docs/moglmorpher)" for fast morphing
and rendering of 3D shapes \*and\* textures. See "help [moglmorpher](/docs/moglmorpher)" for
info on moglmorphers purpose and capabilities.

This demo will load two morpheable shapes from OBJ files and two
textures, then morph them continously into each other, using a simple
sine\-function to define the timecourse of the morph.

Control keys and their meaning: 'a' == Zoom out by moving object away
from viewer. 'z' == Zoom in by moving object close to viewer. 'k' and 'l'
== Rotate object around axis. 'ESC' == Quit demo.

# Options:

dotson = If set to 0 \(default\), just show surface. If set to 1, some dots
are plotted to visualize the vertices of the underlying mesh. If set to
2, the mesh itself is superimposed onto the shape. If set to 3 or 4, then
the projected vertex 2D coordinates are also visualized in a standard
Matlab figure window.

normalson = If set to 1, then the surface normal vectors will get
visualized as small green lines on the surface.

stereomode = n. For n\>0 this activates stereoscopic rendering \- The shape
is rendered from two slightly different viewpoints and one of
Psychtoolbox's built\-in stereo display algorithms is used to present the
3D stimulus. This is very preliminary so it doesn't work that well yet.

usefastoffscreenwindows = If set to 0 \(default\), work on any graphics
card. If you have recent hardware, set it to 1. That will enable support
for fast offscreen windows \- and a much faster implementation of shape
morphing.

This demo and the morpheable OBJ shapes were contributed by Dr. Quoc C.
Vuong, MPI for Biological Cybernetics, Tuebingen, Germany.
