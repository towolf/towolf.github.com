function MorphDemo([textureon][, dotson][, normalson][, stereomode])
MorphDemo -- Demonstrates use of "[moglmorpher](/docs/moglmorpher)" for fast morphing
and rendering of 3D shapes. See "help [moglmorpher](/docs/moglmorpher)" for info on
moglmorphers purpose and capabilities.

This demo will load two morpheable shapes from OBJ files and then
morph them continously into each other, using a simple sine-function
to define the timecourse of the morph.

The demo is OpenGL-ES1 compatible, with some restrictions: Only cpu based,
slower morphing. The dotson flag is ignored.

Control keys and their meaning:
'a' == Zoom out by moving object away from viewer.
'z' == Zoom in by moving object close to viewer.
'k' and 'l' == Rotate object around axis.
'ESC' == Quit demo.

# Options:

textureon = If set to 1, the objects will be textured, otherwise they will be
just shaded without a texture. Defaults to zero.

dotson = If set to 0 (default), just show surface. If set to 1, some dots are
plotted to visualize the vertices of the underlying mesh. If set to 2, the
mesh itself is superimposed onto the shape. If set to 3 or 4, then the projected
vertex 2D coordinates are also visualized in a standard Matlab figure window.

normalson = If set to 1, then the surface normal vectors will get visualized as
small green lines on the surface.

stereomode = n. For n\>0 this activates stereoscopic rendering - The shape is
rendered from two slightly different viewpoints and one of Psychtoolbox's
built-in stereo display algorithms is used to present the 3D stimulus. This
is very preliminary so it doesn't work that well yet.


This demo and the morpheable OBJ shapes were contributed by
Dr. Quoc C. Vuong, MPI for Biological Cybernetics, Tuebingen, Germany.
