FastMaskedNoiseDemo([numRects=1][, rectSize=128][, scale=1])  

Demonstrates how to generate and draw noise patches on-the-fly in a fast  
way. The patches are shown through circular apertures by the use of  
alpha-blending.  

numRects = Number of random patches to generate and draw per frame.  

rectSize = Size of the generated random noise image: rectSize by rectSize  
           pixels. This is also the size of the Psychtoolbox noise  
           texture.  

scale = Scalefactor to apply to texture during drawing: E.g. if you'd set  
scale = 2, then each noise pixel would be replicated to draw an image  
that is twice the width and height of the input noise image. In this  
demo, a nearest neighbour filter is applied, i.e., pixels are just  
replicated, not bilinearly filtered -- Important to preserve statistical  
independence of the random pixel values!  

If you play around with the parameters and compare performance to the  
FastNoiseDemo, you will notice the following:  

- Scaling the stimulus to a bigger size is nearly free on modern graphics  
hardware, so you can generate low-resolution noise stimuli that still  
fill a huge fraction of your display area if you want.  

- Drawing the aperture is nearly free, i.e., this demo runs nearly as  
fast as the FastNoiseDemo without masking. This is because modern  
gfx-hardware is highly optimized for texture drawing and alpha blending.  
The aperture textures are cached in fast onboard VRAM memory to speed up  
drawing them.  

- The drawing speed is mostly limited by how fast Matlab can compute new  
random dot number matrices, not by properties of the stimulus images.
