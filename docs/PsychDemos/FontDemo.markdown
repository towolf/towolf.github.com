FontDemo

Shows how to get the font you want, when you're not
sure what's available, and only certain fonts will do.  This
is a portable solution to the problem of running on various
computers and Operating Systems that offer various fonts.

In the FontDemo program we call CHAR to convert a one-string list,
e.g. {'Arial'}, to a string, e.g. 'Arial'.
