DrawManuallyAntiAliasedTextDemo([textSize=96]) - Manually anti-alias text for special purpose applications.

This demo shows how to draw somewhat anti-aliased text efficiently if you
can't use the operating systems built-in text anti-aliasing for some
reason.

It draws the text oversized, without anti-aliasing, into an offscreen
window. Then it draws the offscreen window into the onscreen window,
applying alpha-blending and bilinear texture filtering, shrinking to 50%
size. A GLSL shader based gaussian blur operator is applied during
drawing to reduce aliasing caused high-frequency edges in the texts
contour.

This needs a modern graphics card to work and is not as efficient as the
operating systems anti-aliasing, but still reasonably fast if done right.
