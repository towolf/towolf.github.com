StereoDemo\(stereoMode\)

Demo on how to use OpenGL\-Psychtoolbox to present stereoscopic stimuli.

DEPRECATED\! THIS DEMO ONLY DEMONSTRATES THE LEGACY STEREO SUPPORT\!
If you have a recent graphics card, have a look at ImagingStereoDemo.m
instead. It demonstrates a much better, more flexible, robust way of
presenting stereo stimuli with Psychtoolbox.

# stereoMode specifies the type of stereo display algorithm to use:

0 == Mono display \- No stereo at all.

1 == [Flip](/docs/Flip) frame stereo \(temporally interleaved\) \- You'll need shutter
glasses that are supported by the operating system, e.g., the
CrystalEyes\-Shutterglasses.

2 == Top/bottom image stereo with lefteye=top also for use with special
CrystalEyes\-hardware.

3 == Same, but with lefteye=bottom.

4 == Free fusion \(lefteye=left, righteye=right\): This \- together wit a
screenid of zero \- is what you'll want to use on MS\-Windows dual\-display
setups for stereo output.

5 == Cross fusion \(lefteye=right ...\)

# 6\-9 == Different modes of anaglyph stereo for color filter glasses:

6 == Red\-Green
7 == Green\-Red
8 == Red\-Blue
9 == Blue\-Red

10 == Dual\-Window stereo: Open two onscreen windows, first one will
display left\-eye view, 2nd one right\-eye view. Direct all drawing and
flip commands to the first window, PTB will take care of the rest. This
mode is mostly useful for dual\-display stereo on MacOS/X. It only works
on reasonably modern graphics hardware, will abort with an error on
unsupported hardware.

11 == Like mode 1 \(frame\-sequential\) but using [Screen](/docs/Screen)'s built\-in method,
instead of the native method supported by your graphics card.
