AudioTunnel3DDemo2 -- A very sketchy and raw demo of how to use OpenAL to
create the illusion of walking through a tunnel which has different sound
sources attached to it.

You'll need a properly configured multi-speaker system or very good
head-phones attached to a very good soundcard and a lot of luck and
goodwill for this to sound good.

OpenAL for Matlab is currently only supported on a subset of platforms,
so this demo may abort quickly with an error.
