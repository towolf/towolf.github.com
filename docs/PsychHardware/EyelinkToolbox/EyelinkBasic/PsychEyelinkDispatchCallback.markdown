Retrieve live eye-image from Eyelink, show it in onscreen window.

This function is normally called from within the Eyelink\(\) mex file.
Normal user code only calls it once to supply the eyelink defaults struct.
This is handled within the EyelinkInitDefaults.m file, so you generally
should not have to worry about this. However, if you change settings in
the el structure, you may need to call it yourself.

To define which onscreen window the eye image should be
drawn to, call it with the return value from EyelinkInitDefaults, e.g.,
w=[Screen](/docs/Screen)\('OpenWindow', ...\);
el=EyelinkInitDefaults\(w\);
myEyelinkDispatchCallback\(el\);


to actually receive and display the images, register this function as eyelink's callback:
if Eyelink\('Initialize', 'myEyelinkDispatchCallback'\) ~=0
    error\('eyelink failed init'\)
end
result = Eyelink\('StartSetup',1\) %put the tracker into a mode capable of sending images
%then you must hit 'return' on the PTB computer, this key command will be sent to the tracker host to initiate sending of images.

This function fetches the most recent live image from the Eylink eye
camera and displays it in the previously assigned onscreen window.

11.4.2009 Cleaned up. Should be ready for 1st release, although still
          pretty alpha quality. \(MK\).
15.6.2010 Added some drawing routines to get standard behaviour back. Enabled
          use of the callback by default. Clarified in helptext that user
