BitValue=DaqDReadBit(DeviceIndex,BitNumber)  
USB-1608FS: Write digital port. This command writes data to the DIO port  
bits that are configured as outputs.  
"DeviceIndex" is a small integer, the array index specifying which HID  
      device in the array returned by PsychHID('Devices') is interface 0  
      of the desired USB-1608FS box.  
"BitNumber" an integer from 0 to 8 specifying which bit to read

\* If your Daq is a USB-1208FS or USB-1408FS, this code has not been tested;  \*  
\* it probably will not run on your device.  The USB-1608FS has only one DIO  \*  
\* port and that is what this code was written to expect.  To make it run on  \*  
\* a 12 or 14 bit device, you should fix this to take an additional input     \*  
\* (the portnumber) and to continue to behave as is for the 16-bit device.    \*  
\* An example of how to do that can be found in DaqDConfigPort.  -- mpr       \*

I suspect that to get this code to work for a 1208FS or 1408FS you would have  
to modify the SetReport call to add the port number (0 or 1) before  
BitNumber.  Hopefully that would be all it would take, but since I don't  
have one of those devices to test, I have not implemented that fix.  Look at  
the code in DaqDOut to see how you might code something that tested for  
whether your Daq has two DIO ports, and how you'd handle input and report to  
accommodate the added port.  

BitNumber can be a vector so that you can read multiple bits at once.
