v=DaqAIn(DeviceIndex,channel,range,[DoNotCalibrate])
Analog input.
USB-1208FS:
"v" is the measured voltage, in Volts, or NaN if no data were received.
"DeviceIndex" is a small integer, the array index specifying which HID
    device in the array returned by PsychHID('Devices') is interface 0
    of the desired Daq device.
"channel" (0 to 15) selects any of various single-ended or differential
    measurements.
    "channel" Measurement
     0        0-1 (differential)
     1        2-3 (differential)
     2        4-5 (differential)
     3        6-7 (differential)
     4        1-0 (differential)
     5        3-2 (differential)
     6        5-4 (differential)
     7        7-6 (differential)
     8          0 (single-ended)
     9          1 (single-ended)
    10          2 (single-ended)
    11          3 (single-ended)
    12          4 (single-ended)
    13          5 (single-ended)
    14          6 (single-ended)
    15          7 (single-ended)
"range" (0 to 7) sets the gain (hence voltage range):
    for single-ended measurements (channels 8-15), range is always +/- 10 V,
    and attempts to set ranges other than 0 usually result in saturation, so
    setting range in this function does not do anything.  For differential
    measurements (channels 0-7), the map between range as input to this
    function and the output generated is:
    0 for Gain 1x (+/-20 V),   1 for Gain 2x (+/-10 V),
    2 for Gain 4x (+/-5 V),    3 for Gain 5x (+/-4 V),
    4 for Gain 8x (+/-2.5 V),  5 for Gain 10x (+/-2 V),
    6 for Gain 16x (+/-1.25 V),  7 for Gain 20x (+/-1 V).
"DoNotCalibrate" for 1208FS has no effect

USB-1608FS:
only single-ended inputs are defined, so "channel" is restricted to integers
from 0 to 7.  Ignore the manual which claims that gains are restricted to only
four possible values.  Thank the linux people for discovering:
     0 for Gain 1x (+/- 10 V),      1 for Gain 2x (+/-5 V),
     2 for Gain 4x (+/- 2.5 V),     3 for Gain 5x (+/- 2 V),
     4 for Gain 8x (+/- 1.25 V),    5 for Gain 10x (+/- 1V),
     6 for Gain 16x (+/- 0.625 V),  7 for Gain 32x (+/- 0.3125 V)

"DoNotCalibrate" (0 or 1) if non-zero, function does not use information
acquired from calibration measurements (see DaqCalibrateAIn).  This should
probably always be 0 when function is called by a user (hence it defaults to
0).  Flag was created for the purpose of acquiring calibration data.
Otherwise subsequent calibration measurements would be fits of fits.

4/15/05 dgp Wrote it.
1/21/07 asg changed normalization value from 2^16 to 2^15 to account for 16th bit as a sign bit (not data bit)
            and modified the "range" value help.
6/17/07 mk  Add proper sign handling for negative voltages.
12/2x/07-1/x/08  mpr   modified to work with USB-1608FS and changed some
                          terminology; particularly did away with "sign" name
                          conflict ("sign" is a Matlab function)
6/07/13 mk  Try to make it more robust: Retry on no-date received, proper
            error handling with error abort on error instead of silent
            failure returning NaN. Cleanup.
