params=DaqAOutScan(DeviceIndex,v,options)
USB-1208FS: Analog output scan. Produce sampled analog output voltage
waveforms on one or two channels. This command sends the values in "v"
(one column per channel) to the specified range of (one or two) output
channels.

"params.fActual" is the actual sampling frequency, sample/channel/s.
      It is as close as possible to the requested sampling frequency
      options.f.
"params.countActual" is the actual total sample/channel sent.
"params.start" is when the first report ("v" data) was sent to the device.
"params.end" is when the final report was sent to device.
"DeviceIndex" is a small integer, the array index specifying which HID
      device in the array returned by PsychHID('Devices') is interface 0
      of the desired USB-1208FS box.
"v" is a matrix, with one column per channel. (If you're using only one
      channel, then you're allowed to send the vector as either a column
      or a row.) Each value is a double, in the range 0 to 1, which will
      produce an output voltage in the range 0 to 4.095 V.
"options.FirstChannel" is the first channel of the scan (0 - 1). (formerly
      "options.lowChannel" -- that terminology is deprecated.)
"options.LastChannel" is the last channel of the scan (0 - 1), and must
      be greater than or equal to options.FirstChannel. The values
      options.FirstChannel and options.LastChannel specify the channel
      range for the scan. (Formerly "options.highChannel" -- that terminology
      is deprecated.)
"options.f" is the desired sampling frequency, sample/channel/s, in the
      range 0.596/c to 10e6/c Hz, where c is the number of channels to be
      scanned.
"options.trigger" is 1 = use external trigger. The external trigger
      may be used to start the scan synchronously. If the bit is set, the
      device will wait until the appropriate trigger edge is detected,
      then begin emitting samples at the specified rate.
"options.getReports" is 1 (default) = wait to receive report from
      USB-1208FS before sending each block of data in "v". 0 = send
      blocks of data at what should be the right rate.
"options.print" is 1 = enable diagnostic printing; 0 (default) no
      diagnostics.

LIMITATIONS: As of 17 April 2005, DaqAoutScan works fine at up to 2000
sample/s with one channel, or up to 200 sample/channel/s with two
channels. (It is surprising that these two limits are not exactly a
factor of 2 apart.) When I try to go faster than that I encounter various
problems. Sometimes I get "data underrun" errors and sometimes the
PsychHID SetReport call hangs up forever, never returning, making it
necessary to quit MATLAB. I don't understand why these things happen;
they shouldn't. I am trying to get help from Measurement Computing and
Apple to understand and overcome this problems. However, in the meantime,
the attained rates are enough for my immediate needs, and hopefully that
will be true for many other users.
