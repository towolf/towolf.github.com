BitsPlusMovieFrameTest

BitsMovieFrame displays a square that flickers between
two levels at the frame rate, using lookup
table animation, using the Bits++ box.

This is a useful stimulus for monitoring with a photodiode
to verify that the clut animation is running at the frame rate.

The routine also contains some timing checks. On our system, these
also confirm frame rate operation.
