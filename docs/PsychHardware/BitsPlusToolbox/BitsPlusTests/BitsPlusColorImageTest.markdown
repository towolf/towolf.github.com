BitsPlusColorImageTest

Use of Color++ mode.

8/8/04  dhb     Started it.
18/4/05   ejw     Converted it to run with OSX version of Psychtoolbox
10/24/13  dhb     Pass scaling args to packing routine and truncate test image.
                  These were needed to make this work with my Bits++ in Color++ mode
                  today.  I think the cropping has to do with the spatial res of my
                  monitor.  How this ever worked without the scaling args, though,
                  is unclear to me.
