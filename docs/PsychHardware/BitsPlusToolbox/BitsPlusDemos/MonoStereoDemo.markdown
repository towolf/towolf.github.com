controlling the FE1 goggles using a Tlock packet.

For use with the OSX version of Psychtoolbox.
tested with version 1.0.5.
uses the hidden 'LoadNormalizedGammaTable' screen function.

Please note that this demo as configured needs 256MB system ram.
It also needs the Bits++ from Cambridge Research Systems!!
Designed to be used in the "mono++" enhanced monochrome mode.

Sections have been lifted from the OSX movie demo etc.
