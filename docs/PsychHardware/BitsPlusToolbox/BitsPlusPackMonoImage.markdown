[theColorImage,reconNewWay,reconOldWay] = BitsPlusPackMonoImage(theMonoImage)  

In Mono++ mode, the Bits++ box uses the red and green  
channels to provide 14-bits per pixel true intensity  
resolution.  The blue channel is set to 0 to let the  
monochromatic image through.   Empirically, we concluded  
that the packing is left adjusted.  That is, the 8 MSB  
of the 14-bit input go into the red channel, and the  
6 LSB get left aligned in the green channel, with  
the remaining two bits set to 0.  

This routine packs the bits properly for this function.  

11/17/03  dhb, ip   Wrote it.  
8/13/04 dhb     Fix bug, the data were not packed quite right.  
2/26/07   mk      Bugfix for LSB conversion: Added modulo operation.  
3/01/07   mk      Bugfix for MSB conversion: Added floor operation.  
3/04/07   dhb     Modified to return some debugging information and  
                  compare original with recent version.
