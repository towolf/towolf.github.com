WriteStructsToText(filename,theStructs)

Write a tab delimited text file.  The first row should
contain the field names for a structure.  Each following
row contains the data for one instance of that structure.

This routine writes each element of the structure array as a row.
Only numeric and string field values are supported.

If the filename is a string, this routine handles opening and
closing of the file.  Otherwise, this routine assumes
that what was passed is a valid fid and uses it as such,
leaving the calling routine to do the opening and closing.
